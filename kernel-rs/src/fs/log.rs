//! Simple logging that allows concurrent FS system calls.
//!
//! A LOG transaction contains the updates of multiple FS system
//! calls. The logging system only commits when there are
//! no FS system calls active. Thus there is never
//! any reasoning required about whether a commit might
//! write an uncommitted system call's updates to disk.
//!
//! A system call should call begin_op()/end_op() to mark
//! its start and end. Usually begin_op() just increments
//! the count of in-progress FS system calls and returns.
//! But if it thinks the LOG is close to running out, it
//! sleeps until the last outstanding end_op() commits.
//!
//! The LOG is a physical re-do LOG containing disk blocks.
//! The on-disk LOG format:
//!   header block, containing block #s for block A, B, C, ...
//!   block A
//!   block B
//!   block C
//!   ...
//! Log appends are synchronous.
