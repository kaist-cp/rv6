//! The lock module.
//! Contains types that provide mutual exclusion.
//!
//! # Locks and [`Pin`]
//! Locks that own `!Unpin` data of type `T` should not give an `&mut T` of its data to the outside.
//! Similarly, we should not be able to mutably dereference a lock guard if the data `T` is `!Unpin`.
//! Otherwise, we could move the inner data, even when the lock itself is pinned.
//!
//! Therefore, locks in this module gives an `&mut T` to the outside only when `T: Unpin`.
//! Otherwise, it only gives a [`Pin<&mut T>`].
//! Similaraly, guards implement [DerefMut](`core::ops::DerefMut`) only when `T: Unpin`, and if `T: !Unpin`,
//! you should obtain a [`Pin<&mut T>`] from the guard and use it instead.
//!
//! # RemoteLock
//! A `RemoteLock`, such as [`RemoteSpinlock`], [`RemoteSleepablelock`], or [`RemoteSleeplock`], owns its data but does not have its own raw lock.
//! Instead, it borrows another [`Lock`] (such as [`Spinlock`], [`Sleepablelock`], or [`Sleeplock`]) and protects its data using it.
//! That is, a [`Lock`] protects its own data *and* all other connected `RemoteLock`s' data.
//!
//! This is useful in several cases.
//! * When multiple fragmented data must be protected by a single lock.
//!   * e.g. By making multiple `RemoteLock`s borrow a single [`Spinlock`],
//!     you can make multiple data be protected by a single [`Spinlock`], and hence,
//!     implement global locks. In this case, you may want to use an [`Spinlock<()>`]
//!     if the [`Spinlock`] doesn't need to hold data.
//! * When you want a lifetime-less smart pointer (such as [`Ref`](crate::rc_cell::Ref) or [`Rc`](std::rc::Rc))
//!   that points to the *inside* of a lock protected data.
//!   * e.g. Suppose a [`Lock`] holds a [`RcCell`](crate::rc_cell::RcCell). Suppose you want to provide a
//!     [`Ref`](crate::rc_cell::Ref) that borrows this [`RcCell`](crate::rc_cell::RcCell) to the outside, but still want
//!     accesses to the [`RcCell`](crate::rc_cell::RcCell)'s inner data to be synchronized.
//!     Then, instead of providing a [`Ref`](crate::rc_cell::Ref), you should provide a [`Ref`](crate::rc_cell::Ref) wrapped by a `RemoteLock`.
//!     to the outside.
