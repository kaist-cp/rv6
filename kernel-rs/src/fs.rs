/// Inodes.
///
/// An inode describes a single unnamed file.
/// The inode disk structure holds metadata: the file's type,
/// its size, the number of links referring to it, and the
/// list of blocks holding the file's content.
///
/// The inodes are laid out sequentially on disk at
/// sb.startinode. Each inode has a number, indicating its
/// position on the disk.
///
/// The kernel keeps a cache of in-use inodes in memory
/// to provide a place for synchronizing access
/// to inodes used by multiple processes. The cached
/// inodes include book-keeping information that is
/// not stored on disk: ip->ref and ip->valid.
///
/// An inode and its in-memory representation go through a
/// sequence of states before they can be used by the
/// rest of the file system code.
///
/// * Allocation: an inode is allocated if its type (on disk)
///   is non-zero. ialloc() allocates, and iput() frees if
///   the reference and link counts have fallen to zero.
///
/// * Referencing in cache: an entry in the inode cache
///   is free if ip->ref is zero. Otherwise ip->ref tracks
///   the number of in-memory pointers to the entry (open
///   files and current directories). iget() finds or
///   creates a cache entry and increments its ref; iput()
///   decrements ref.
///
/// * Valid: the information (type, size, &c) in an inode
///   cache entry is only correct when ip->valid is 1.
///   ilock() reads the inode from
///   the disk and sets ip->valid, while iput() clears
///   ip->valid if ip->ref has fallen to zero.
///
/// * Locked: file system code may only examine and modify
///   the information in an inode and its content if it
///   has first locked the inode.
///
/// Thus a typical sequence is:
///   ip = iget(dev, inum)
///   ilock(ip)
///   ... examine and modify ip->xxx ...
///   iunlock(ip)
///   iput(ip)
///
/// ilock() is separate from iget() so that system calls can
/// get a long-term reference to an inode (as for an open file)
/// and only lock it for short periods (e.g., in read()).
/// The separation also helps avoid deadlock and races during
/// pathname lookup. iget() increments ip->ref so that the inode
/// stays cached and pointers to it remain valid.
///
/// Many internal file system functions expect the caller to
/// have locked the inodes involved; this lets callers create
/// multi-step atomic operations.
///
/// The icache.lock spin-lock protects the allocation of icache
/// entries. Since ip->ref indicates whether an entry is free,
/// and ip->dev and ip->inum indicate which i-node an entry
/// holds, one must hold icache.lock while using any of those fields.
///
/// An ip->lock sleep-lock protects all ip-> fields other than ref,
/// dev, and inum.  One must hold ip->lock in order to
/// read or write that inode's ip->valid, ip->size, ip->type, &c.
