/// Buffer cache.
///
/// The buffer cache is a linked list of buf structures holding
/// cached copies of disk block contents.  Caching disk blocks
/// in memory reduces the number of disk reads and also provides
/// a synchronization point for disk blocks used by multiple processes.
///
/// Interface:
/// * To get a buffer for a particular disk block, call bread.
/// * After changing buffer data, call bwrite to write it to disk.
/// * When done with the buffer, call brelse.
/// * Do not use the buffer after calling brelse.
/// * Only one process at a time can use a buffer,
///     so do not keep them longer than necessary.
